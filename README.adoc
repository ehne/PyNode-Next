= PyNode Next

> A complete rewrite of PyNode for the modern era.

== Getting Started
To get started, download the https://github.com/ehne/PyNode-Next/releases/latest[latest version of PyNode Next] and place the folder in your project's directory.

[NOTE]
====
PyNode Next requires https://github.com/algrx/algorithmx-python[AlgorithmX], so you might need to install that if you haven't done so previously. 
This can usually be done by running the following in your terminal.

[source, bash]
----
$ python3 -m pip install algorithmx
----
====

Then all you need to do is create a new python file that looks like this and you can start writing code for PyNode Next.

[source, python]
----
from pynode_next import *

def run():
    # put your python code here.
    # here is an example of what you could do:
    graph.add_node("a")
    graph.add_node("b")

    graph.add_edge("a", "b")

begin_pynode_next(run)
----

== Migrating from PyNode
PyNode Next has been designed to maintain the vast majority of all of the functions from the previous version of PyNode.

Switching to PyNode Next _should_ be as simple as replacing `from pynode.main import *` with `from pynode_next import *`. And adding a `_next` to the `begin_pynode` function call.
