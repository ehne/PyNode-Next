= PyNode Next

> A complete rewrite of PyNode for the modern era.

PyNode Next allows you to easily create beautiful graph visualisations and animations. 


toc::[]



== Getting started
To get started, download the https://github.com/ehne/PyNode-Next/releases/latest[latest version of PyNode Next] and place the folder in your project's directory.

[NOTE]
====
PyNode Next requires https://github.com/algrx/algorithmx-python[AlgorithmX], so you might need to install that if you haven't done so previously. 
This can usually be done by running the following in your terminal.

[source, bash]
----
$ python3 -m pip install algorithmx
----
====

Then all you need to do is create a new python file that looks like this and you can start writing code for PyNode Next.

[source, python]
----
from pynode_next import *

def run():
    # put your python code here.
    # here is an example of what you could do:
    graph.add_node("a")
    graph.add_node("b")

    graph.add_edge("a", "b")

begin_pynode_next(run)
----

== Migrating from PyNode
PyNode Next has been designed to maintain the vast majority of all of the functions from the previous version of PyNode.

Switching to PyNode Next _should_ be as simple as replacing `from pynode.main import *` with `from pynode_next import *`. And adding a `_next` to the `begin_pynode` function call.

def run()
    # code
    graph.add_node("a")

from pynode_next import *

def run()
    # code
    graph.add_node("a")

begin_pynode_next(run)

== Differences from the original PyNode
* Certain methods are _strongly_ typed. Meaning that they only accept input of specific types. This is due to how the overloading system works, and will be documented whenever it pops up.
* Keyword arguments (that's stuff like the `id=` in `add_node(id="a")`) might be broken in some methods due to the overloading system.
* `outline` options on methods don't exist any more. Text no longer has any outlines.
* You can no longer compare nodes with other nodes like `NodeA > NodeB`. To do this now, you need to specify the priority: `NodeA.priority() > NodeB.priority()`
* The above also applies to edges.
* `graph.random()` has been drastically simplified to just take `order` and `size` arguments.
* `node.position()` has not been implemented yet. (The rendering library PyNode Next uses has a different coordinate system to that of the original PyNode)

== Documentation
The docs have been moved to https://github.com/ehne/PyNode-Next/tree/main/docs/documentation.adoc[docs/documentation.adoc]
